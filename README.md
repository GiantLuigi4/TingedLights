## But why?
After all, Shimmer and Colored Lights both already exist

Shimmer and Colored Lights both don't use lighting engines for their colored lights
They simply use a lighting manager, and tint vanilla's light based on distance

Tinged Lights however, used a lighting engine (or well, currently multiple engines)
This allows lights to properly be obstructed by walls instead of either having light go through, or having colors go through

In the future, when I have a more custom lighting engine, This would also allow me to have glass tint the light color
